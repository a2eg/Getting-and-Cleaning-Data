# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This repository was created for the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project and it
stores the documentation (CodeBook.md), the tidy data set (tidy.txt) and R script (run_analysis.R).

Wearable computing is one of the most exciting areas in all of data science these days.
A lot of companies (Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up and others) are developing the advanced algorithms to attract new customers. 
The data used in this project represents the accelerometers collected measurements from the Samsung smartphones. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The dataset being used is:

The script is preparing tidy data set that could be used for later analysis.
Please check CodeBook.md file for detailed description of data, variables, and any data transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
